# Attention Is All You Need: The Birth of the Transformer

In 2017, Vaswani and colleages published a page: Attention Is All You Need. This work introduced the **Transformer**, a neural network architecture that removed the need for recurrence and convolution in sequence modeling, paved the way for the development of modern large language models.

## What is Attention?

The attention mechanism allows models to focus on different parts of the input sequence when processing each element. Instead of processing information sequentially like traditional RNNs, attention enables parallel processing and better handling of long-range dependencies.

## Prior Problems
Before Transformers, the dominant models for natural language tasks were **RNNs** and **LSTMs**. These models processed sequences step by step, making them difficult to parallelize and slow to train. They also struggled with **long-range dependencies**, since information had to pass sequentially through many steps, often vanishing along the way.

### 1. Sequential Bottlenecks Slow Training
Because each hidden state depends on the one before it, RNNs cannot process a sentence in *parallel*. Training must happen step by step, which becomes a serious bottleneck for long sequences.

Example:
```text
I love machine learning.
```
To process this simple sentence, an RNN must:
1. Process “I” → state h1
2. Process "love" with h1 -> state h2
3. Process "machine" with h2 -> state h3
4. Proces "learning" with h3 -> state h4

Even for short sentences this is inefficient, and for millions of sequences in large datasets, it makes training extremly slow.

### 2. Long-Distance Dependencies Are Hard


There were some approaches like Convolutional methods tried to improve parallelism but still required multiple layers to capture relation of distant parts (tokens, words). The challenge remained: **how to model long-range relationships efficiently**
