# Attention Is All You Need: The Birth of the Transformer

In 2017, Vaswani and colleages published a page: Attention Is All You Need. This work introduced the **Transformer**, a neural network architecture that removed the need for recurrence and convolution in sequence modeling, paved the way for the development of modern large language models.

## What is Attention?

The attention mechanism allows models to focus on different parts of the input sequence when processing each element. Instead of processing information sequentially like traditional RNNs, attention enables parallel processing and better handling of long-range dependencies.

## Prior Problems
Before Transformers, the dominant models for natural language tasks were **RNNs** and **LSTMs**. These models processed sequences step by step, making them difficult to parallelize and slow to train. They also struggled with **long-range dependencies**, since information had to pass sequentially through many steps, often vanishing along the way.

### 1. Sequential Bottlenecks Slow Training
Because each hidden state depends on the one before it, RNNs cannot process a sentence in *parallel*. Training must happen step by step, which becomes a serious bottleneck for long sequences.

Example:
```text
I love machine learning.
```
To process this simple sentence, an RNN must:
    1. Process “I” → state h1
    2. Process "love" with h1 -> state h2
    3. Process "machine" with h2 -> state h3
    4. Proces "learning" with h3 -> state h4

Even for short sentences this is inefficient, and for millions of sequences in large datasets, it makes training extremly slow.

### 2. Long-Distance Dependencies Are Hard
RNNs process sequences word by word, passing information from one node to the next in the network. This makes it difficult to remember relationships between words that are far apart.

Example:
```text
The park, which is 1 km away from my house, is a wonderful place for dating.
```
To predict the word *"dating"*, the model needs to recall that *"The park"* appeared at the beginning. But because RNNs pass
information step by step (park -> which -> is -> ...), the signal can weaken or vanish along the way. This is the classic **vanishing gradient problem**.

## The Key Idea: Attention
The Transformer solved this by replying entirely on **attention mechanism**. Instead of processing tokens one by one, attention lets the model directly *look at* every other word
in the sequence - no matter how far apart. This significantly reduces path lengths between dependencies and allows for massive parallelization during training.

The general attention mechanism can be expressed as:
$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}(\text{score}(Q, K)) \cdot V
$$

**Where:**

- Q (Query): What information am I looking for?
- K (Key): What information is available?
- V (Value): The actual information content

The most commonly used attention mechanism is scaled dot-product attention
$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\!\left(\frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) V
$$

**Where:**

- $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_k}$: Query matrix (n queries, each of dimension $d_k$)
- $K \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times d_k}$: Key matrix (m keys, each of dimension $d_k$)
- $V \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times d_v}$: Value matrix (m values, each of dimension $d_v$)
- $d_k$: Dimension of keys (used for scaling)
- The scaling factor $\sqrt{d_k}$ prevents the dot products from growing too large







There were some approaches like Convolutional methods tried to improve parallelism but still required multiple layers to capture relation of distant parts (tokens, words). The challenge remained: **how to model long-range relationships efficiently**
